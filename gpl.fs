s" \w          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE " >m-scroll
s"           Version 3, 29 June 2007 " >m-scroll
s"           Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> " >m-scroll
s"           Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies " >m-scroll
s"           of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. " >m-scroll
s"           This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates " >m-scroll
s"           the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public " >m-scroll
s"           License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. " >m-scroll
s" \r          0. Additional Definitions. " >m-scroll
s"           As used herein, 'this License' refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser " >m-scroll
s"           General Public License, and the 'GNU GPL' refers to version 3 of the GNU " >m-scroll
s"           General Public License. " >m-scroll
s"           'The Library' refers to a covered work governed by this License, " >m-scroll
s"           other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. " >m-scroll
s"           An 'Application' is any work that makes use of an interface provided " >m-scroll
s"           by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. " >m-scroll
s"           Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode " >m-scroll
s"           of using an interface provided by the Library. " >m-scroll
s"           A 'Combined Work' is a work produced by combining or linking an " >m-scroll
s"           Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library " >m-scroll
s"           with which the Combined Work was made is also called the 'Linked Version'. " >m-scroll
s"           The 'Minimal Corresponding Source' for a Combined Work means the " >m-scroll
s"           Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code " >m-scroll
s"           for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are " >m-scroll
s"           based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. " >m-scroll
s"           The 'Corresponding Application Code' for a Combined Work means the " >m-scroll
s"           object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data " >m-scroll
s"           and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the " >m-scroll
s"           Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. " >m-scroll
s" \g          1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. " >m-scroll
s"           You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License " >m-scroll
s"           without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. " >m-scroll
s" \b          2. Conveying Modified Versions. " >m-scroll
s"           If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a " >m-scroll
s"           facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application " >m-scroll
s"           that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the " >m-scroll
s"           facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified " >m-scroll
s"           version: " >m-scroll
s"           a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to " >m-scroll
s"           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the " >m-scroll
s"           function or data, the facility still operates, and performs " >m-scroll
s"           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or " >m-scroll
s"           b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of " >m-scroll
s"           this License applicable to that copy. " >m-scroll
s" \y          3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. " >m-scroll
s"           The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from " >m-scroll
s"           a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object " >m-scroll
s"           code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated " >m-scroll
s"           material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure " >m-scroll
s"           layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates " >m-scroll
s"           (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: " >m-scroll
s"           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the " >m-scroll
s"           Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are " >m-scroll
s"           covered by this License. " >m-scroll
s"           b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. " >m-scroll
s" \m          4. Combined Works. " >m-scroll
s"           You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, " >m-scroll
s"           taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the " >m-scroll
s"           portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse " >m-scroll
s"           engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of " >m-scroll
s"           the following: " >m-scroll
s"           a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that " >m-scroll
s"           the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are " >m-scroll
s"           covered by this License. " >m-scroll
s"           b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. " >m-scroll
s"           c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during " >m-scroll
s"           execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among " >m-scroll
s"           these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the " >m-scroll
s"           copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. " >m-scroll
s"           d) Do one of the following: " >m-scroll
s"           0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this " >m-scroll
s"           License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form " >m-scroll
s"           suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to " >m-scroll
s"           recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of " >m-scroll
s"           the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the " >m-scroll
s"           manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying " >m-scroll
s"           Corresponding Source. " >m-scroll
s"           1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the " >m-scroll
s"           Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time " >m-scroll
s"           a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer " >m-scroll
s"           system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version " >m-scroll
s"           of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. " >m-scroll
s"           e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise " >m-scroll
s"           be required to provide such information under section 6 of the " >m-scroll
s"           GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is " >m-scroll
s"           necessary to install and execute a modified version of the " >m-scroll
s"           Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the " >m-scroll
s"           Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If " >m-scroll
s"           you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany " >m-scroll
s"           the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application " >m-scroll
s"           Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation " >m-scroll
s"           Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL " >m-scroll
s"           for conveying Corresponding Source.) " >m-scroll
s" \c          5. Combined Libraries. " >m-scroll
s"           You may place library facilities that are a work based on the " >m-scroll
s"           Library side by side in a single library together with other library " >m-scroll
s"           facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this " >m-scroll
s"           License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your " >m-scroll
s"           choice, if you do both of the following: " >m-scroll
s"           a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based " >m-scroll
s"           on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, " >m-scroll
s"           conveyed under the terms of this License. " >m-scroll
s"           b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it " >m-scroll
s"           is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the " >m-scroll
s"           accompanying uncombined form of the same work. " >m-scroll
s" \b          6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. " >m-scroll
s"           The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions " >m-scroll
s"           of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new " >m-scroll
s"           versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may " >m-scroll
s"           differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. " >m-scroll
s"           Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the " >m-scroll
s"           Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version " >m-scroll
s"           of the GNU Lesser General Public License 'or any later version' " >m-scroll
s"           applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and " >m-scroll
s"           conditions either of that published version or of any later version " >m-scroll
s"           published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you " >m-scroll
s"           received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser " >m-scroll
s"           General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser " >m-scroll
s"           General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. " >m-scroll
s"           If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide " >m-scroll
s"           whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall " >m-scroll
s"           apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is " >m-scroll
s"           permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library." >m-scroll
